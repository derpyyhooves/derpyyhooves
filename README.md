feel free to int/c+h! hi!!! im going to start this off by saying that im 18, and if youre under 16 probably dont try friending me (i can int/c+h! thats fine :3), but i will most likely be very Uncomfortable and want to Run, especially if youre being weird, so keep that in mind and interact w caution ^^ also, i may or may not be high. dw you can just ask if it helps clear the air... see what i did there.. so be aware as i might not talk much/be a bit slower to understand you, im usually uncomfortable with friending people i dont know well enough, and will most likely end up unfriending you later if i am sent a request (i find it hard to not accept them when being asked upfront and/or i get sent a friend request out of the blue, im awkward and i feel bad about it, so sorry, but warnings given!!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT INFO:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i am awkward and my mood fluctuates easily, sorry if im acting off, however im almost always nice, or may i be quiet, but if i am somehow rude for no reason then i apologise as im usually not unless provoked somehow, and even then i still might not do anything, im a sensitive person in general, i find it hard to voice my discomforts at times, so please try to keep this in mind especially if youre gonna say something weird right off the bat, i dont always like talking/typing, using words can be overwhelming at times especially if im not in a good mood, i know it might sound cringe but please try to be understanding of this, im usually happy to boop/use emotes though, if you dont like that, then dni

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i block freely, however it is most likely due to someone doing smth in my basic dni list, or making me uncomfortable, but it is not limited to just that. that being said, be sure to scroll down to learn more about me if youd like! ^^
